## Content Guidelines

### General Principles
1. **Progressive Disclosure**: Non-tech → Medium-tech → Deep-tech
2. **Verification Required**: Mark unverified claims with `⚠️ VERIFY:`
3. **Code is Law**: When in doubt, reference actual Aiken code
4. **Practical Focus**: Examples over theory
5. **Mermaid Diagrams**: Use for all visual aids (renders in GitHub)
6. **Clear Navigation**: Link related sections

### Standards Coverage (LIGHT TOUCH ONLY)
- **DO**: Mention CIP-143 as the base standard
- **DO**: Brief mention that programmable tokens enable regulatory compliance
- **DO**: Link to external standards docs for reference
- **DON'T**: Deep dive into MiFID II, FATF, ISO 20022, etc.
- **DON'T**: List all possible regulatory use cases
- **KEEP IT**: 1-2 sentences max per standard/regulation

### Blacklist Operations
- **Scope**: Example use case only
- **Coverage**: How it works at high level
- **Detail Level**: Reference to `blacklist_mint.ak` without deep explanation
- **Purpose**: Show extensibility, not comprehensive feature docs

### Validator Documentation (High-Level)
- **Focus**: What each validator does and why
- **Logic**: High-level validation flow (not line-by-line)
- **Security**: What attack vectors are prevented
- **No**: Detailed code walkthroughs (code speaks for itself)

- Credential flexibility: stake key, payment key, or script hash in stake slot
- On-chain validators are credential-agnostic (VerificationKey vs Script only)
- Choice of credential type is a protocol/off-chain design decision

#### 1. For Wallet Developers (~150 lines)

- **Token Discovery**: How to query the on-chain registry
- **Stake Delegation**: Implications for each credential type (minimal ADA, but technically possible)
- **Common Pitfalls**: Table of frequent integration mistakes

#### 2. For Indexers and Explorers (~150 lines)
- **Balance Tracking**: Group UTxOs by stake credential at `programmable_logic_base`, handle script owners
- **Credential Type Ambiguity**: Payment key vs stake key hashes are indistinguishable on-chain
- **TX History by Stake Address**: Standard case (straightforward)
- **TX History by Payment Key in Stake Slot**: Enterprise/CEX pattern — query payment key hash as a stake credential

- **Registry State Tracking**: Token registrations, transfer logic, compliance events
- **Common Pitfalls**: Table of frequent integration mistakes

- **Transaction Building**: Multiple simultaneous withdraw-zero invocations, composing with dApp logic
- **Script Requirements**: Must implement `withdraw` purpose, stake address registration
- **Delegation and Withdrawal**: Distinguishing zero-ADA (authorization) from real withdrawals

- **Composability Patterns**: Receiving, releasing, and holding mixed assets
- **Common Pitfalls**: Table of frequent integration mistakes
